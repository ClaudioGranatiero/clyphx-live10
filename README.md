# ClyphX Ableton Live script which works with Live 10

ClyphX 2.6.2 is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, which means that anybody can modify and distribute it for free. It has less features than Clyph
X Pro, but the 2.6.2 is the last free version to work with Live 10.

You can still use it but do not try to get support on nativeKONTROL forums, it is not supported by them anymore.

## Installation

* Get the ZIP in the releases.
* Unzip it in Ableton 'Midi Remote Scripts'
* Add ClyphX as a new control surface in Ableton's preferences (input and output = None)
* Enjoy!
